CSI API ETABS v1

# Overview  
  
---  
  
The steps that follow provide a general overview of the procedure for
connecting to ETABS through the API.

  1. Early bind to the interface: “ETABSv1.dll” for .NET 4.5 clients and “ETABSv1.tlb” for COM clients. 

  2. Late bind to “ETABS.exe”, create an instance of the "ETABSObject“, and get a reference to the “cOAPI” interface. 

  3. Use the “cOAPI” interface to start/end the program and get a reference to the ”cSapModel” interface to access all API classes and functions. 

  4. **This step is only necessary when ETABS.exe is located on a network share.**

Find the configuration file for the API client ([clientname].exe.config) under
its installation folder and add the following to it:

XML

Copy

         
         <configuration>
           <runtime>
             <loadFromRemoteSources enabled="true" />
           </runtime>
         </configuration>

If the configuration file is not present, create it with the above contents.
