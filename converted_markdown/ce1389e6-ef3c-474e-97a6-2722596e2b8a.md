CSI API ETABS v1

# Breaking changes in v19.0.0, v19.0.1, and v19.0.2  
  
---  
  
The following inadvertent changes broke compatibility with earlier API
versions:

  * In ETABS v19.0.0 (ETABSv1.dll version 1.10 and CSiAPIv1.dll version 1.10), eMatTypeSteel_Chinese_Q345 enumeration got renamed to eMatTypeSteel_Chinese_Q355. 
    * Affected programs: 
      * ETABS v19.0.0, v19.0.1, v19.0.2 
    * Affected API clients: 
      * Compiled COM clients (e.g. VB6, Delphi) failed to start. 
      * Interpreted COM clients (e.g. VBA) failed to compile/run if the affected enumeration was used. 
    * Fix: 
      * eMatTypeSteel_Chinese_Q345 enumeration was reinstated 

  * ETABS versions 19.0.0, 19.0.1, and 19.0.2 and corresponding ETABSv1.dll versions 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12 and CSiAPIv1.dll versions between 1.9 and 1.13 should not to be used for developing plug-ins and/or API scripts to ensure full compatibility with past and future API versions.
