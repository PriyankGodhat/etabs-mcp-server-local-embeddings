![](../icons/SectionExpanded.png)Remarks

The analysis results are returned in a collection of one-dimensional result
arrays. Each result array is created as a dynamic array by the API user. As an
example, in VB .NET a dynamic string array is defined by:

VB

Copy

    
    
    Dim MyArray() as String

The array is dimensioned to (NumberResults– 1) inside the program, filled with
the result values, and returned to the API user.

The arrays are zero-based. Thus the first result is at array index 0, and the
last result is at array index (NumberResults- 1). For example, the StepType()
array is filled as:

VB

Copy

    
    
    StepType(0) = Step type for first result returned

VB

Copy

    
    
    StepType(1) = Step type for second result

VB

Copy

    
    
    StepType(NumberResults- 1) = Step type for last result

Immediately before requesting results data, it is a good idea to clear the
SelectedForOutput flag for all load cases and response combinations and then
to set the flag True for those cases and combos for which output is to be
generated. This avoids confusion as to which cases and combos are currently
selected for output.
