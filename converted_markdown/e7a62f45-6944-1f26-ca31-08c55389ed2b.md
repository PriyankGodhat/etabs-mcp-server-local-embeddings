#### Parameters

Name

    Type: [SystemString](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string)  
The name of an existing static nonlinear staged load case

Stage

    Type: [SystemInt32](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.int32)  
The stage in the specified load case for which data is requested. Stages are
numbered sequentially starting from 1

NumberOperations

    Type: [SystemInt32](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.int32)  
The number of operations in the specified stage

Operation

    Type: [SystemInt32](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.int32)  
This is an array that includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 11, indicating an
operation type.

1| Add structure  
---|---  
2| Remove structure  
3| Load objects if new  
4| Load objects  
5| Change section properties  
6| Change section property modifiers  
7| Change releases  
11| Change section properties and age  
  
ObjectType

    Type: [SystemString](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string)  
This is an array that includes the object type associated with the specified
operation. The object type may be one of the following:

  * Group
  * Frame
  * Cable
  * Tendon
  * Area
  * Solid
  * Link
  * Point

The following list shows which object types are applicable to each operation
type:

Operation = 1 (Add structure)| All object types  
---|---  
Operation = 2 (Remove structure)| All object types  
Operation = 3 (Load objects if new)| All object types  
Operation = 4 (Load objects)| All object types  
Operation = 5 (Change section properties)| All object types except Point  
Operation = 6 (Change section property modifiers)| Group, Frame, Cable, Area  
Operation = 7 (Change releases)| Group, Frame  
Operation = 11 (Change section properties and age)| All object types except
Point  
  
ObjectName

    Type: [SystemString](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string)  
This is an array that includes the name of the object associated with the
specified operation. This is the name of a Group, Frame object, Cable object,
Tendon object, Area object, Solid object, Link object or Point object,
depending on the ObjectType item

Age

    Type: [SystemDouble](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.double)  
This is an array that includes the age of the added structure, at the time it
is added, in days. This item applies only to operations with Operation = 1.

MyType

    Type: [SystemString](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string)  
This is an array that includes a load type or an object type, depending on
what is specified for the Operation item. This item applies only to operations
with Operation = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 11.

When Operation = 3 or 4, this is an array that includes Load or Accel,
indicating the load type of an added load.

When Operation = 5 or 11, and the ObjectType item is Group, this is an array
that includes Frame, Cable, Tendon, Area, Solid or Link, indicating the object
type for which the section property is changed.

When Operation = 6 and the ObjectType item is Group, this is an array that
includes Frame, Cable or Area, indicating the object type for which the
section property modifiers are changed.

When Operation = 7 and the ObjectType item is Group, this is an array that
includes Frame, indicating the object type for which the releases are changed.

When Operation = 5, 6, 7, or 11, and the ObjectType item is not Group and not
Point, this item is ignored and the type is picked up from the ObjectType
item.

MyName

    Type: [SystemString](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.string)  
This is an array that includes a load assignment or an object name, depending
on what is specified for the Operation item. This item applies only to
operations with Operation = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 11.

When Operation = 3 or 4, this is an array that includes the name of the load
assigned to the operation. If the associated MyType (load type) item is Load,
this item is the name of a defined load pattern. If the associated MyType
(load type) item is Accel, this item is UX, UY, UZ, RX, RY or RZ, indicating
the direction of the load.

When Operation = 5 or 11, this is the name of a Frame, Cable, Tendon, Area,
Solid or Link object, depending on the object type specified.

When Operation = 6, this is the name of a Frame, Cable or Area object,
depending on the object type specified.

When Operation = 7, this is the name of a Frame object.

SF

    Type: [SystemDouble](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.double)  
This is an array that includes the scale factor for the load assigned to the
operation, if any. [L/s2] for Accel UX UY and UZ; otherwise unitless

This item applies only to operations with Operation = 3 or 4.

#### Return Value

Type: [Int32](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.int32)  
Returns zero if the data is successfully retrieved; otherwise, it returns a
nonzero value
