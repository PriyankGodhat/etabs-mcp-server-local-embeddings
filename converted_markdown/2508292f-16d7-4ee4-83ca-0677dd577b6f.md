# Introduction  
  
---  
  
This document illustrates how to connect to ETABS using the CSI Application
Programming Interface (API) from a variety of clients.

The API is defined in the form of a .NET 4.7.1 dynamic link library, and is
implemented by ETABS. It can be accessed from .NET 4.7.1 and COM based
clients.

Please note that ETABS must be installed both on the API client development
machine, and on the client end-user's machine.
