CSI API ETABS v1

# Launching the Installed Version of ETABS Automatically  
  
---  
  
With the release of ETABS 2016 v16.1.0, new functionality has been added to
the cHelper interface to allow users to launch the application without
supplying the path to the ETABS.exe . The example code is in VB.NET.

  1. Previously, users would launch the program with the function cHelper.CreateObject , providing the full path to the ETABS.exe as an argument, as below: 

VB

Copy

         
         Dim myETABSObject As ETABSv1.cOAPI
         Dim myHelper as ETABSv1.cHelper = New ETABSv1.Helper
         
         myETABSObject = myHelper.CreateObject("C:\Program Files (x86)\Computers and Structures\ETABS 18\ETABS.exe")
         
         ret = myETABSObject.ApplicationStart()
         
         Dim mySapModel As ETABSv1.cSapModel = myETABSObject.SapModel

  2. While the code above is still available, a simpler method has been added to cHelper . The CreateObjectProgID function takes the Program ID as an argument, and automatically launches the most recently installed version of ETABS: 

VB

Copy

         
         Dim myETABSObject As ETABSv1.cOAPI
         Dim myHelper as ETABSv1.cHelper = New ETABSv1.Helper
         
         myETABSObject = myHelper.CreateObjectProgID("CSI.ETABS.API.ETABSObject")
         
         ret = myETABSObject.ApplicationStart()
         
         Dim mySapModel As ETABSv1.cSapModel = myETABSObject.SapModel
